In this project ,I designed a todoApplication where somebody can add its tasks ,check/uncheck it by clicking the checkbox next to it.

At the backend ,I have used NoSQL (Mongodb) DB and front end I have used React and Redux because I wanted a common place where state can be reached all other components if needed .
